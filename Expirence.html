								<p> Being the youngest member of my family, I have been given more opportunities to achieve my dreams. Since my childhood years, I was always interested in learning how different technology worked this led to me constantly opening computers or kitchen appliances to stare at their circuit boards. A high school mentor taught me that we only have one chance in life to make something out of our lives. Knowing my passion for technology I educated myself in various programming languages and researched extracurricular activities that would help me reach my goal.
It was been almost 4 years since I started to learn about the tech field. Throughout the four years, my experience has grown from being able to assembly multiple computers, troubleshoot computers/cellphones, and creating a small website. Any opportunity that is presented to me I will make sure to take, letting people down is something that I cannot do. I would work well as a IT/help desk, reason being I have experience in the field and I am willing to continue to help any company improve.
