									<br/>
									<p> Dear Hiring manager, <p/>

									<p>I am writing to you because I am interested in the IT support Engineer II position. I want to work for amazon because I like the company’s vision, I do believe that this company will help bring new elements to the near future. I would be a good candidate for this position because I have experience in working with two different corporations as a intern. I also have a certification in CompTIA A+ earning this certification I was able to learn how to troubleshoot and computer hardware. Lastly, I can work well with a team I would be able to help keep a calm work environment. <p/>

									<p> I am interested in this position because I enjoy working with different work environments. I do not mind the travel that is required for this position. Working with two different corporations as a intern I have been able to gain experience in real life problems that a IT person would run into. Having a CompTIA, A+ certification I have learned all that is needed to repair hardware and OS troubleshooting. As a It support Engineer II, I would need those skills to be able to work fast and efficiently. I would not want to relay on others to check my work.<p/>
									<p> Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my letter. I have included my resume with my letter. If you have any questions, please contact me fabianortiz9091@gmail.com. I hope to meet you in person soon thank you for your time. <p/>
										<br/>
										<p> Fabian Ortiz <p/>
