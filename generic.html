								<p>	Hello Kathleen,<br/>
									<br/>
									I am emailing you because  my assignments you have given me were not clear to me.
               		I am unsure if you want me to prioritize a certain assignment, or if I need to leave a project.
							 		If we could meet to discuss this it would be very helpful. I am sorry I was not able to understand the time set of the projects.
                   <br/>
									 Thank you,

								 <p> Email #2 is a email I sent to a instructor when asked :"What were my soft skills?" .</p>
 								<p>	Hi Kathleen,<br/>
 									<br/>
									A soft skill that I have is helping build community. I am able to get a group to talk to each other and become friends.
									I was able to use this skill when I was at a internship, I only knew one intern out of the 8 of us there. I was able to help
									create  a community and helping everyone know each other. For example by the end of the internship I was able to talk to
									all the interns if I needed help or they could contact other in a group chat I created. This helped everyone by making the internship fun
									by being able to talk to other our age.  Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my email.
